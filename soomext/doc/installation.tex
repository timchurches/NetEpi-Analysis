The extension module code is used by the Python wrapper module
\module{SOOM.py}.

\end{itemize}

robust for other people.

\subsection{Testing}

interactive Python prompt.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> from soomfunc import *
>>> from Numeric import *
>>> intersect(array(range(10)) + 4, array(range(5)) * 2)
array([4, 6, 8])
\end{verbatim}
