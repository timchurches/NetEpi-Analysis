<H1>NetEpi Analysis Version 0.1 Web interface – a brief
introduction</H1>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>This document provides a brief introduction to the Web interface
for NetEpi Analysis (NEA) Version 0.1. Please note that this is an
early version of the application and it is highly likely that the
interface and capabilities of NEA will change considerably as it is
developed further.</P>
<P>NEA was designed and written by Tim Churches (Centre for
Epidemiology and Research, NSW Department of Health) and Andrew
McNamara (Object Craft Pty Ltd, working under contract to NSW
Department of Health). Dave Cole and Ben Golding, also both of Object
Craft Pty Ltd, contributed fast set-theoretic functions and a filter
clause parser respectively.</P>
<P>NEA uses several (somewhat) unusual techniques to ensure
reasonable performance when dealing with moderately-sized datasets
(up to about 10 million records), despite being programmed in a
highly dynamic, late-binding, object-oriented programming language
(Python). In particular, all datasets are stored in vertically
partitioned form – that is, column-wise, not row-wise, and dataset
summarisation is achieved using set-theoretic operations on ordinal
mappings – that is, the ordinal row position in each column is used
as an implicit row ID and set intersections (and other set
operations) are performed on these row IDs. This approach differs
from more commonly used bit-mapped indexes in that value indexes are
stored as vectors of sorted integer indexes – an approach which
sacrifices some performance on very large datasets, but which retains
storage and processing efficiency even for columns with very high
cardinality, without having to use complex bitmap compression
schemes. High cardinality data are routinely encountered in health
and epidemiological datasets. A peer-reviewed paper describing these
techniques appeared in 2003 – please see: <A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12725961">Churches
T. Exploratory data analysis using set operations and ordinal
mapping. Comput Methods Programs Biomed 2003; 71(1):11-23</A>.
Preprint copies of the paper in PDF format are available from the
author on request (email: <A HREF="mailto:tchur@doh.health.nsw.gov.au">tchur@doh.health.nsw.gov.au</A>)
if your institution or organisation does not have access to this
journal.</P>
<P>This tutorial assumes that NEA has been installed on a suitable
computer and that the demonstration datasets have been loaded. If
not, please see the README file in the top level NEA directory for
instructions on creating these datasets. We also recommend that you
run the api_demo.py and plot_demo.py programmes in the demo
subdirectory to gain an appreciation of the programmatic interface to
NEA, which can be used directly in any batch or interactive Python
programme, before working through this introduction to the Web
interface. Instructions for running demo/api_demo.py and
demo/plot_demo.py can be found in the README file mentioned above.</P>
<P>Please report all bugs, problems, feature requests and ideas for
future development to the NetEpi-discuss mailing list. You need to
subscribe to this list in order to post messages to it – please see
the <A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/netepi-discuss">list
management Web page</A>.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>NEA
home page</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The first step is to open your Web browser and type in the URL for
the NEA demonstration. If you are using nea-standalone.py to host the
demonstration Web site on your own computer, then the URL will
generally be http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/nea/nea.py If the
demonstration is being hosted on an Apache web server, the URL will
be something like http://some_server/cgi-bin/nea/nea.py where
some_server is the DNS name of the host server.</P>
<P>Note that unless your system administrator has established access
control within Apache, no username or password is required to access
the NEA demonstration site. Future versions of NEA will provide
built-in user authentication and access control facilities.</P>
<P>The home page displays two pull-down lists with buttons besides
each.</P>
<P>The upper pull-down list allows you to select a dataset to work
with. As new datasets are added to directories within the SOOM engine
search path, they automatically appear in this list. Clicking on the
<B>[Explore]</B> button displays metadata about the selected data in
a new browser window. You can click on the <B>[View]</B> button to
the left of each column name to see further details for that column.</P>
<P>The lower pull-down list allows you to select a type of analysis
to perform on the selected dataset. At this stage the analyses are
restricted to exploratory graphs and tables. More sophisticated and
specialised types of epidemiological analyses will be added in future
versions.</P>
<P>Several of the features and facilities are common to all types of
analyses. These will be covered in detail in the context of bar
charts, but will not be mentioned for other types of analyses, as
they work in the same fashion everywhere in NEA.</P>
<P>Choose the National Hospital Discharge Survey dataset from the
upper pull-down list, and Bar Chart from the lower analysis type
pull-down list. Click the <B>[Analyse]</B> button. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Filters</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>The Filter section allows you to specify filters to restrict your
analysis to certain rows in the dataset. The text area shows the
current filter expression. You can directly enter filter expressions
here if you wish. The syntax is very similar to SQL WHERE clause
syntax, with a few differences and extensions. In particular, the
equality operator is “==”, not “=” (this may change in a
later version). The logical operators AND, OR and NOT are supported,
as is bracketing (and nested bracketing) of expressions. An “in”
operator is provided, which tests for values in a list e.g. “column_a
in (1, 2, 3)” is equivalent to “column_a == 1 OR column_a == 2 OR
column_a ==3 “. It is also possible to test whether string values
start with certain substrings by suffixing a colon eg column_b ==:
'A' will select all values in column_b which start with 'A'.</P>
<P>However, it is usually easier to use the filter editor to define
dataset filters. To do this, click the <B>[New]</B> button to the
right of the filter text box. You will be presented with the filter
editing page. The filter is shown diagrammatically on the left of the
page, with the currently selected clause of the filter highlighted in
light pink. Edit controls for the currently selected clause appear in
a panel in the middle of the page, and various action buttons appear
on the right.</P>
<P>To edit a clause, click the red “target” symbol to the left of
the clause (if the filter is new and thus undefined, a blank clause
denoted by “???” should already be highlighted. In the edit panel
in the middle of the page, select a column for the filter clause from
one of the three pull-down lists provided, and then click the <B>[&gt;&gt;]</B>
button (the clause editor operates as a “wizard” or “druid”,
allowing you to move to the next step or the previous step by
clicking the <B>[&gt;&gt;]</B> or <B>[&lt;&lt;]</B> buttons
respectively).</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The operator expression section of the
clause will then be highlighted, and you can choose an appropriate
operator from the pull-down list. Note that the “starts with”
operators only work with string values (which may be strings of
numerals, eg ICD-9-CM codes). Then click the <B>[&gt;&gt;]</B> button
again. 
</P>
<P>The value section of the clause editor will display a pull-down
selection box for categorical or ordinal columns with small or
moderate cardinality – select a value form the list (or multiple
values if the “in” operator has been used – hold down the <B>Ctrl</B>
key to select multiple items). For high cardinality columns, and
scalar columns, a text box is displayed in which an appropriate value
can be entered. Future versions of NetEpi Analysis will have better
methods for selecting values for high cardinality columns such as
those which contain ICD codes. If the column you selected is a date
column, then components of the date may be selected from pull-down
lists (the next version will support specification of time and
date/time values in the filter editor as well).</P>
<P>When you have specified the value, click the <B>[&gt;&gt;]</B>
button again. The filter clause editor panel will disappear from the
middle of the page, and the filter clause will be shown on the left. 
</P>
<P>To edit that clause again, or to add new clauses, click on the
target symbol at the left-hand side of the clause. The clause editor
panel will re-appear in the middle of the page.</P>
<P>To add additional clauses to the filter, click on the <B>[and]</B>
or <B>[or]</B> buttons in the lower left-hand corner of the clause
editor panel. The <B>[Delete]</B> button at the lower right of the
clause editor panel has the obvious effect.</P>
<P>By repeating the above steps, complex filters can be built up and
displayed in diagrammatic form. When you have finished, you can click
the <B>[Okay]</B> button on the right of the page. The filter which
you have defined will then appear in the filter text box on the
analysis parameters page. Note that although you can edit the filter
definition directly in the text box on the analysis parameter pages,
your edits will not be reflected in the state of the filter displayed
on the filter editor page - in other words, the connection between
the two is only unidirectional, from filter editor to filter text
box, at this stage.</P>
<P>For more complex filter definitions, rather than just clicking
<B>[Okay]</B>, it is a good idea to give the definition a name and
description by clicking on the <B>[Edit info]</B> button, and then
clicking the <B>[Save]</B> button to save the filter definition. Note
that filter definitions are currently shared between all users.
Future versions of NEA will provide user-specific workspaces.</P>
<P>If you make a mistake while editing a filter definition, you can
use the <B>[Undo]</B> and <B>[Redo]</B> buttons to roll back or roll
forward the changes you have made to the definition.</P>
<P>Saved filter definitions can be loaded by selecting the definition
by name from the pull-down list to the right of the filter text box
and clicking <B>[Load]</B>. Loaded or current filter definitions can
be edited by clicking the <B>[Edit]</B> button.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Titles
and Footers</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>These text boxes allow you to specify titles and footers for your
graphs and tables. They are automatically populated with text, which
is adjusted each time you set various parameters. You can adjust the
contents of the title and footer text boxes if you wish. However, if
you do edit the text, no further automatic changes will be made until
you start a new analysis. (Note that for Summary Tables and
Crosstabs, the titles and footers text boxes are populated after you
run the analysis – they can then be edited and the analysis re-run.
In future versions the behaviour will be made the same as the plot
analysis types.) 
</P>
<P>Future versions will allow similar editing of graph axis labels
and table row and column headings.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Output
format</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>For graphs, you can change the format of the output by choosing
PNG (web graphics), PDF or SVG formats. SVG requires a browser
plug-in or stand-alone SVG viewer – see the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/SVG-Implementations">W3C
Web page on SVG implementations</A> for more information. After
selecting a new format, click the <B>[Change]</B> button. The size or
orientation of the selected output format can be set using the radio
buttons on the right. Future versions will permit greater control
over output size and orientation, as well as a wider range of output
formats.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Bar
charts</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>You should have the Bar Chart parameter specification page
displayed.</P>
<P>The <B>X Column</B> selection list allows you to select a column
to use as the X axis of the bar chart. The X axis is by convention
the horizontal axis, but selecting the <B>Horizontal</B> check box
makes the X axis the vertical axis (and thus the bars horizontal).
Note that only categorical, ordinal and date columns are available
for selection for the bar chart X axis.</P>
<P>The <B>Measure Column</B> pull-down list is used to select the
type of measure to use for the Y axis of the bar chart – that is,
the quantity which determines the height (or length) of each bar. It
defaults to <B>Frequency</B>, weighted by the default weighting
column for the dataset, if there is one. Other weighting columns can
be chosen if they are available for the dataset in question, or
weighting can be disable by selecting “No weighting” from the
weighting pull-down selection list (the rightmost one of the three).
For some types of measures, such as mean or median, a scalar column
must be chosen as the basis of the measure, using the middle
pull-down selection list.</P>
<P>Note also that the first measure shown is the list is a proportion
(of weighted or unweighted frequencies, as appropriate) for each
category on the X axis. If stacking, grouping or paneling columns are
also specified (see below), then proportions for combinations of each
of these conditioning columns are also automatically made available
for use. Future versions may offer automatic calculation of
proportions of other quantities other than counts, where this makes
sense. Support for other forms of ratio may also be added.</P>
<P>A <B>Group By</B> column can also be specified – this causes
separate bars to be displayed for each value of the Group By column.
Selecting the <B>Stack</B> check box causes stacking (division of
bars) rather than side-by-side grouping.</P>
<P>One or more paneling columns can similarly be specified by
clicking on the <B>[Add]</B> button in the <B>Panel(s</B>) section.
This causes separate bar charts to be created in panels for each
value of paneling column(s). It is not a good idea to specify more
than two or three paneling columns. Also, it is possible to use
scalar columns for paneling, in which case the paneling columns will
be automatically partitioned into ranges. However, for large,
unfiltered datasets, this can be an exceedingly slow operation.
Future versions will advise users of this fact and offer
alternatives, such as faster binning of scalar columns in Numeric
Python before passing data to R for plotting.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Finally, the origin of bar charts can
be specified using the <B>Origin</B> text box.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Dot
charts</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Dot charts are very similar to bar charts, except that dots are
used instead of bars. All of the parameters are the same as for bar
charts, except that <B>Group-by Column</B> is replaced by <B>Stack-by
Column</B> because dots are always stacked along a single line for
each value of the axis column. 
</P>
<P>Future versions will permit the size, shape and colour of the dots
to be set by the user.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Line
plots</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Line plots are designed to display time series data, using date,
time or date/time columns for the X axis. However, categorical and
ordinal columns can also be used for the X axis. In other respects,
the parameters for line plots are similar to those for bar and dot
charts. Once again, future versions will permit the width, style and
colour of lines to be set by the user (this can already be done via
the programmatic interface).</P>
<P>When a date column is used for the X axis, NEA tries to select
appropriate tick mark points. More control over this will be provided
in future versions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Histogram
and density plots</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>These allow a single scalar column to be specified. For
histograms, the <B>Bins</B> parameter allows the number of bars in
the histogram to be set. Future versions will also allow parameters
for density plots to be set.</P>
<P>Note that histogram and density plots, as well as box plots and
scatter plots (see below), involve the transfer of all the data
(after filtering) for the selected column from Python to R. This can
be both slow and use a great deal of memory. Therefore, when using
large datasets, it is recommended that filters are used to limit the
amount of data being processed. Future versions will warn the user of
this issue and offer optional random or stratified random sampling of
data used for these types of plots.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Box-and-whisker
plots</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Only scalar columns can be chosen for the Y axis, and only
categorical, ordinal or date columns can be chosen for the X axis.
The <B>Outliers</B> and <B>Notches</B> options currently have no
effect. Future versions may calculate the statistics needed for
drawing the box plots in Numeric Python, which may speed this type of
analysis considerably for large datasets.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Scatter
plots</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>These are self-explanatory. Only scalar columns can be chosen for
the X and Y axes. Better tick marks for log-scaled axes are on the
TO-DO list for future versions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Scatter
matrix plots </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P>The <B>Measures</B> parameter allows several scalar columns to be
selected. A matrix of scatter plots is then displayed for each pair
of columns.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Summary
tables</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>This produces simple summaries, similar to those produced by
GROUP-BY in SQL or PROC SUMMARY in <A HREF="http://www.sas.com/">SAS</A><FONT FACE="Bitstream Vera Serif">&reg;</FONT>.
Zero or more categorical, ordinal or date columns can be chosen (by
clicking the <B>[Add]</B> button) to condition the summary. One row
of summary data is produced for each combination of values in each of
the conditioning columns. Zero or more <B>Statistics</B>, which are
equivalent to <B>Measures</B> in the plots, can be specified (if none
are specified then unweighted frequency counts are shown). The
inconsistency in nomenclature (<B>Measures</B> versus <B>Statistics</B>)
will be corrected in a future version, and the ability to specify
frequency proportions and other ratios will be added, as will the
ability to save the output as a new dataset, and to export it as a
CSV or other data file for use in other programmes.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Crosstabs</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Cross-tabulations may be
produced using this analysis type. At least one categorical, ordinal
or date <B>Column</B> column and one one categorical, ordinal or date
<B>Row</B> column must be specified. Note hwever that more than one
Row or Column column can be specified, in which case the row or
column value headings are nested. By default, crosstabs display
frequency counts, weighted according to the setting of the <B>Weight
by column</B> parameter. Other statistics may be added to the table.
Proportions of frequency counts can also be added by selecting one or
more proportions in the <B>Proportions</B> list box (hold down the
<B>Crtl</B> key to select more than one). The method for selecting
proportions will be made more like that used for the plots in a
future version.</P>
<P>The <B>Heatmap</B> check box
demonstrates the use of table cell shading – in the current
version, cells are shaded based on absolute value – future versions
will offer a range of shading options based on the expectation for
each cell in the table. <B>Marginal Totals</B> may be added at the
top and left of rows and columns respectively, or at the bottom and
right (or suppressed entirely, which is the default).</P>
<P>On some browsers, complex
crosstabs may not display correctly – if so, retry the analysis
after selecting the <B>Use simplified table rendering</B> check box.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Demonstration
datasets</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Programmes to load two
demonstration datasets are provided. The US National Hospital
Discharge Survey dataset provides a moderately sized dataset (just
over 2 million records) which represents a sampled survey (and yes,
we are aware that the variance estimates do not current account for
the survey design effects – a future version will correct this).
Please be sure to observe the data use restrictions which the National Center for
Health Statitics attaches to these files (see the various README files at 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/NHDS/">ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/NHDS/</a> ).
Some sample WHO national health indicator data are also provided
(please see the README file in the demo subdirectory for
instructions on how to obtain fresh version of these indicator data).
The WHO indicator dataset is small, but provides many more scalar
columns (as well as demonstrating some  current deficiencies in the
axis labelling routines...).  You are encouraged to load additional
datasets to try out. At the moment there is no formal documentation
of the API for loading datasets, but it should be fairly obvious from
the examples in the demo/loaders subdirectory, as well as from the
programme source code. Full documentation will of course be included
in future versions.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Future
