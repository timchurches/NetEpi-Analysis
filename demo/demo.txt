#20a. Now let's explore some wheresets (where clauses).
>>> nhds.makewhereset("test1",var1="race",op1="=",val1=2,var2="discharge_status",op2="=",val2=1)
Assembling whereset test1 containing 7418 elements took 0.087 seconds.

That took 0.088 seconds.

##############################################################################

#20b. Now make another where clause.
>>> nhds.makewhereset("test2",var1="sex",op1="=",val1=2)
#     Note that currently you need to know that 2 means female but the
#     next version will allow the user to specify either "female" or 2
#     and it will translate to teh stored value (which is 2). It is obviously
#     desirable to store categories as integer or other codes, but why should
#     the user need to consult a code book to formulate a where clause?
Assembling whereset test2 containing 22368 elements took 0.056 seconds.

That took 0.057 seconds.

##############################################################################

#20c. And yet another where clause, this time using a date value.
>>> nhds.makewhereset("test3",var1="randomdate",op1="=",val1=mx.DateTime.Date(1996,10,12))
Assembling whereset test3 containing 29 elements took 0.106 seconds.

That took 0.106 seconds.

##############################################################################

#20d. Use the first whereset to filter the dataset. Note how fast the filtering is.
>>> print nhds.quadrivar(wheresetname="test1",var1="race",var2="sex",var3="geog_region",var4="marital_status",wgtvar="analysis_wgt",cellvar="age",wgtmean=1,wgtn=1,printit=1,allcalc=1)
wheresetload(): memory mapping of test1 containing 7418 elements took 0.005 seconds.

quadrivar(): Quadrivariate setup time 0.014 seconds.

Quadrivariate summary derived from geog_region, marital_status, race and sex columns in nhds dataset
Using whereset test1 containing 7418 elements
quadrivar(): Quadrivariate summary created in 0.772 seconds.
Time in intersect() function was 0.107 seconds.
